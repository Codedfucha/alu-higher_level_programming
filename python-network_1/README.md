# Python Network #1: Fetching Web Data

## Project Overview

This project involves creating Python scripts that interact with the web using the `urllib` package. The tasks are designed to demonstrate the ability to make HTTP requests, handle responses, and manipulate data from web servers. The project follows specific guidelines to ensure code quality and adherence to PEP 8 standards.

## Requirements

- **Allowed Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Python Version**: The scripts will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3.
- **Code Style**: PEP 8 (version 1.7)
- **Executable Files**: All files must be executable.
- **Documentation**: All modules, classes, and functions must include documentation explaining their purpose.

## Tasks

### Task 0: What's my status? #0

Write a Python script that fetches the URL `https://alu-intranet.hbtn.io/status` and displays the body of the response. The output should include the type of the response, the content in its raw `bytes` format, and the UTF-8 decoded content.

- **Filename**: `0-hbtn_status.py`
- **Usage**: 
  ```bash
  ./0-hbtn_status.py
